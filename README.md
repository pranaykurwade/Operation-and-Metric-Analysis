# Operation-and-Metric-Analysis

# Problem Description:
Operation Analytics involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement, enhancing cross-functional understanding, and optimizing workflows. As a Data Analyst Lead at a company like Microsoft, I derive insights from various datasets to address departmental queries. Key metrics include the number of jobs reviewed, throughput, language share, duplicate rows, user engagement and growth, weekly retention and engagement, and email engagement. Investigating metric spikes, such as dips in daily engagement or sales, is crucial for daily operations. This analysis ensures effective responses to operational challenges.
