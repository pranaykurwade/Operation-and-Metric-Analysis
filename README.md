# Operation-and-Metric-Analysis

# Problem Description:
Operation Analytics involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations to identify areas for improvement, enhancing cross-functional understanding, and optimizing workflows. As a Data Analyst Lead at a company like Microsoft, I derive insights from various datasets to address departmental queries. Key metrics include the number of jobs reviewed, throughput, language share, duplicate rows, user engagement and growth, weekly retention and engagement, and email engagement. Investigating metric spikes, such as dips in daily engagement or sales, is crucial for daily operations. This analysis ensures effective responses to operational challenges.

# Project Approach:
Firstly, I spent some time on understanding the data/table given. I cleared the questions which was in my mind like what does the job_id, actor_id, event means and what are the things to consider while reviewing the data. I use SQL to derive different insights from the dataset provided by the management team. I first created a database “operation_analytics” and then the tables using the structure and links provided by the team. Then, we performed analysis to generate valuable insights for the company.

# Tech Stack Used:
The tech stack used include of MySQL Workbench which is an excellent tool for querying the database.
